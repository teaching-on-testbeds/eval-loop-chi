# Evaluation of ML systems by closing the feedback loop

In this tutorial, we will practice selected techniques for evaluating machine learning systems, and then monitoring them in production. It is one of a 3-part series:

* [Offline evaluation of ML systems](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-offline-chi/)
* [Online evaluation of ML systems](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-online-chi/)
* **Evaluation of ML systems by closing the feedback loop** (this part!)

In this particular section, we will practice evaluation in the *online* testing stage - when the system is serving real users - by "closing the loop" between production use of the service, and continuous evaluation/monitoring and re-training.

Follow along at [Evaluation of ML systems by closing the feedback loop](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-loop-chi/).

This tutorial uses: one `m1.medium` VM at KVM@TACC, and one floating IP.
